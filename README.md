# Text Based game testing center

I created this application while i was learning c#. I wanted to create a text based game with some combat features.
Im going to revamp a lot of this using a database to hold a lot of the information as opposed to class.

i learned a lot about inheritance and classes and Object-oriented programming as i keep making changes to this project
